# PanelAppRex
Aggregating and analysing gene panel data in R from Genomics England

## Overview
PanelAppRex is an R project aimed at aggregating and analysing gene panel data from Genomics England's PanelApp. Our repository integrates data that is used in both the NHS National Genomic Test Directory and the virtual gene panels used in the 100,000 Genomes Project. This dataset facilitates research and development by providing insights into disease-gene correlations and enhancing variant classification methodologies.

## Source
Our main data source is the Genomics England PanelApp, accessible [here](https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk). PanelApp hosts comprehensive gene panels related to genomic tests covered by the NHS, as well as data from historic genomic projects.

## Objectives
The goal of PanelAppRex is to prepare a single dataset that is flexible and instantly usable for human genetic analysis.
