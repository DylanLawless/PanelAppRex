Gene panel data is critical for variant interpretation and genomic diagnostics, yet existing resources remain fragmented, inconsistently annotated, and difficult to interrogate programmatically. We present PanelAppRex, a harmonised resource and interactive search platform integrating over 58,000 curated gene-disease panel associations, including NHS-approved diagnostic panels. It supports natural language-style queries by gene, phenotype, disease group, and mode of inheritance (MOI), returning machine-readable results in multiple export formats. The system achieved 100\% top-panel accuracy in benchmarked case studies of genetic immune disease diagnosis. The core dataset includes standardised gene identifiers, disease annotations, MOI, and supporting literature, enabling integration into bioinformatic pipelines. Beyond interactive search, PanelAppRex provides a structured foundation for modelling genome-wide diagnostic priors and evidence-aware variant interpretation. 

\noindent \textbf{Availability:} The platform data and source code is openly available at [ZENODO LINK] and \url{https://github.com/DylanLawless/PanelAppRex}. PanelAppRex is available under the MIT licence. 
The dataset is maintained for a minimum of two years following publication.

\section{Introduction}
\noindent
Disease-gene panels are widely used in both clinical and research settings to support the diagnosis and interpretation of genetic disorders. 
These panels provide structured lists of genes known to be associated with specific phenotypes or disease groups, helping clinicians prioritise candidate variants during genomic analysis. 
Sources like \ac{ge}’s PanelApp and PanelApp Australia host comprehensive, expert-curated panels that are actively maintained to reflect new genetic knowledge \cite{martin_panelapp_2019}. 
For instance, these resources are integral to the NHS National Genomic Test Directory and the 100,000 Genomes Project \cite{martin_panelapp_2019}. 
Despite their utility, these panel datasets are distributed across multiple platforms and formats, and are difficult to aggregate programmatically without data loss or inconsistency. 
Manual selection, interpretation, and cross-referencing of gene panels remain labour intensive, especially when integrating with other variant-level annotations from genomic resources. 

Accurate causal variant interpretation requires consistent integration of structured annotations from key resources such as \ac{ge}’s PanelApp, ClinVar, UniProt, and Ensembl \cite{martin_panelapp_2019, landrum_clinvar_2018, the_uniprot_consortium_uniprot_2025, dyer_ensembl_2025}. 
To address this, we developed PanelAppRex, a tool that automates panel aggregation and prepares a machine-readable dataset with complete coverage of core gene-level fields, including gene identifiers, inheritance modes, disease terms, and supporting evidence. 
The dataset is suitable for integration into AI-based workflows and downstream variant interpretation pipelines. 
In parallel, PanelAppRex provides a natural language-style search interface that streamlines discovery by supporting queries based on gene names, phenotypes, disease groups, and other key attributes. 
This functionality is enhanced by evidence-based \ac{rag}, allowing users to explore curated gene panel information efficiently. 

\section{Materials and methods}

\subsection{Data}
The PanelAppRex core model contained 58,592 entries consisting of 52 sets of annotations, including the gene name, disease-gene panel ID, diseases-related features, confidence measurements.
Disease interactions were sourced from \ac{ge}’s PanelApp
\cite{martin_panelapp_2019}.
Data from gnomAD v4 comprised 807,162 individuals, including 730,947 exomes and 76,215 genomes \cite{karczewski2020mutational}. This dataset provided 786,500,648 single nucleotide variants and 122,583,462 InDels, with variant type counts of 9,643,254 synonymous, 16,412,219 missense, 726,924 nonsense, 1,186,588 frameshift and 542,514 canonical splice site variants. ClinVar data were obtained from the variant summary dataset 
%(this version: 16 March 2025)
 available from the NCBI FTP site, and included 6,845,091 entries, which were processed into 91,319 gene classification groups and a total of 38,983 gene classifications 
% for example, the gene \textit{A1BG} contained four variants classified as likely benign and 102 total entries 
\cite{landrum_clinvar_2018}. 
Data from Ensembl was sourced for validation of identifiers such as \ac{omim} gene IDs and \ac{hgnc} symbols
\cite{dyer_ensembl_2025}.
% For our analysis phase we also used dbNSFP which consisted of a number of annotations for 121,832,908 single nucleotide variants  \cite{liu_dbnsfp_2020}. 

\subsection{Implementation}
\noindent
PanelAppRex was implemented in R and integrated data from the sources listed above.
It performed credentialed access to APIs to retrieve all approved panels, merging them into two formats: a simplified version (Panel ID, Gene) and a complex version including metadata such as confidence level, \ac{moi}, and disease information, and several metadata summary statistics. In addition, the tool incorporated a search module to execute complex user queries. The search functionality supports queries by gene names, phenotypes, disease names, disease groups, panel names, genomic locations and other identifiers. 
\ac{rag} was used to improve the natural queries in hidden states based on evidence about the disease and gene function by supplementing the data with additional sources including ClinVar, UniProt, etc. 

\subsection{Usage}
\noindent
We provide both a pre-compiled user interface and an analysis-ready dataset.
On a desktop browser, the user interface allows for queries via the integrated search bar in \ac{html}, where a JavaScript function splits the query into individual terms and progressively filters all entries - retaining only those that match all active terms while ignoring unmatched ones. This enables users to perform complex, partial matching queries (e.g. ``paediatric \textit{RAG1} primary immunodeficiency skin disorder'') to rapidly identify the panel most closely associated with their hypothesis on primary immunodeficiency and paediatric skin disorders.
After querying and selecting a panel, the complete underlying data is returned.

The analysis-ready dataset contains the same dataset in multiple file formats.
Our recommended strategy is a bioinformatic approach which can use the union of returned panels, or to apply a scoring system to rank panels in multi-group analyses.
Bioinformatically, users can import the provided, ready-for-use, datasets in TSV or Rds formats.
A typical use case might involve users merging with their own omic data based on gene or Ensembl ID.
The following code snippet, available in \texttt{minimal\_example.R}, demonstrates how to load the data in R:
\begin{verbatim}
# TSV format
path_data <- "../data"
core_path <- paste0(path_data, "/PanelAppData_combined_core")
minimal_path <- paste0(path_data, "/PanelAppData_combined_minimal")

df_core <- read.table(
    file= paste0(core_path, ".tsv"), 
    sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

df_minimal <- read.table(
    file= paste0(minimal_path, ".tsv"), 
    sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

# Rds format
rds_path <- paste0(path_data, "/PanelAppData_combined_Rds")
df_core <- readRDS(file= rds_path)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Validation for completeness in core data}
\noindent
To ensure the reliability and completeness of the core dataset, we systematically assessed whether key gene-level fields were present for each entry after merging the core dataset.
Specifically, we checked for non-missing values in gene symbols, associated publications, disease panel names, \ac{moi}, and \ac{omim} gene IDs. 
Where \ac{hgnc} or Ensembl gene IDs were missing, we used programmatic queries to the Ensembl database via the `\texttt{biomaRt}' R package to recover the identifiers using the available \ac{hgnc} symbol as input \cite{steffen_durinck_biomart}. 
This validation step was applied to the full integrated PanelAppRex dataset.

\subsection{Benchmarking for manual queries}
\noindent
To mimic a clinician who is trying to diagnose a new disease such as \ac{pid}, we systematically selected genetic diagnosis case studies from the current online catalogue from the \ac{jaci}, using the first five results  \cite{arruda_genetic_2015, 
mcaleer_severe_2015,
verhoeven_hematopoietic_2022,
magerus-chatinet_autoimmune_2013,
sharfe_fatal_2014}. 
Although the method presented here is generalisable to genetic diagnosis across disease areas, we chose to validate it using \ac{pid} case studies, as this is the primary focus of our own research.

The clinical background from each of these studies was used to construct keyword queries from patient features, simulating a naïve starting position for a clinician.
We then tested whether our PanelAppRex tool could successfully retrieve panels that included the final causal gene reported in each case study. 
The sources, queries, and results are shown in \textbf{Table \ref{tab:benchmark}}. 

\section{Results}
\noindent
\subsection{Core dataset}
PanelAppRex successfully aggregated data, currently from 451 panels, and several genomics databases to offer a user-friendly search functionality (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:performance}}).
Users can retrieve results filtered by gene names, phenotypes, disease groups and other criteria. 
The system returned a table view with panel details and provided options for exporting results in \ac{csv}, Excel, or \ac{pdf} formats.
Bioinformatic uses may include generating virtual panels, constructing prior odds, or supporting formal reporting in qualifying variant protocols.
Summary statistics are reported in 
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:summary_stats}}. The majority of genes were cited with high confidence. Some genes were present in more panels that others; for instance, RAG1 was present in 7 panels. The majority of panels had fewer than 1000 genes; a
 examples we annotate 
panel ID 398 with 572 genes of \ac{pid} which are well established as consensus in the community, also called \ac{iei} and a second example
of panel ID 1220 with 1675 genes which are associated with unexplained death in infancy and sudden unexplained death in childhood and also called \ac{iem}.

\subsection{Validation shows completeness in the core dataset}
\noindent
The raw dataset exhibited near-complete coverage in most fields after merging the core dataset. 
Specifically, 99.9915\% of gene entries had \ac{hgnc} symbols % (58587/58592)*100
and 99.2315\% had Ensembl gene IDs. % (57844/58292)*100
All entries included at least one publication, a disease panel name, a \ac{moi}, and an \ac{omim} gene ID (100\% each). 
After recovery of missing identifiers, completeness reached 100\% across all these core fields.
This validated dataset ensures that users can confidently build on a consistent foundation, using standardised and stable identifiers to link or enrich the core data with external resources (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:validation}}).

\subsection{Benchmarking for manual queries confirms accurate retrieval of causal gene}
\noindent
To evaluate the practical utility of our system on a desktop browser, we applied the benchmarking approach described in methods using five published case studies of \ac{pid}
\cite{arruda_genetic_2015, 
mcaleer_severe_2015,
verhoeven_hematopoietic_2022,
magerus-chatinet_autoimmune_2013,
sharfe_fatal_2014}. % results
The tool's query process retrieved gene panels using natural language-style input. 
For example, in the first case study on Hereditary Angioedema, the authors reported suspecting that the condition was linked to ``\textit{SERPING1}, Factor XII, and edema" which we used as the query terms. 
Although the true causal gene term \textit{F12} (using its official \ac{hgnc} name) was not mentioned, the inclusion of the alias name and/or related disease terms enabled the system to correctly retrieve the panel containing \textit{F12} based on the hidden search knowledge.

While an expert might readily recognise ``Factor XII'' as an alias name for \textit{F12}, this correct query result demonstrates that the system can make such connections automatically, supporting users with varying levels of genetic expertise.

In our evaluation, PanelAppRex returned panels in which the causal gene was present in 93\% of all returned panels, with the subjective user-selected ``best panel'' achieving a perfect accuracy of 100\% 
(\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:performance}}).
 These metrics were derived by comparing the causal gene identified from the case study abstracts to the panels returned by our query, and by applying a subjective relevance measure to mimic intuitive panel selection - acknowledging that certain panels, such as the established \ac{pid} gene panel, are inherently more reliable than broader, less specific panels.
% (i.e. \ac{pid} panel instead of COVID-19 research panel for  diagnosis of immune disorder}). 
Overall, the results confirm that our approach accurately identifies the most relevant panels and effectively supports clinical decision-making in complex diagnostic scenarios.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{\textbf{Summary of case study queries and PanelAppRex results.} *Case study 5 had five individual cases and patient information was significantly longer that other studies. It was therefore converted to keyword query automatically by the OpenAI model o3-mini to remove subjective bias and align with the other queries.
``Subjective best panels'' are those reasonably preferable to the clinical query and unlikely to be excluded by users. In the benchmark scenario, broad or less relevant panels (e.g. ``COVID-19 research'') might be deprioritised in favour of more clinically aligned options such as ``Fetal anomalies'', or ``Paediatric disorders''. Summarised in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:performance}}.

\section{Discussion and conclusion}
\noindent
PanelAppRex provides an accessible and validated platform for querying, aggregating, and exporting curated disease-gene panel data. Designed for both clinical and research use, it simplifies study planning and variant interpretation through a user-friendly interface, while also offering a harmonised dataset for programmatic workflows. The core model integrates over 58,000 panel-gene associations, with full coverage of key fields including \ac{hgnc} symbols, Ensembl IDs, \ac{omim} annotations, \ac{moi}, and supporting publications.

Beyond immediate usability, PanelAppRex lays a foundation for genome-wide statistical modelling of disease risk. 
With annotations for gene-disease relationships, the dataset can support rigorous estimation of the prior probability of observing  variant classifications (e.g. benign, pathogenic) under different \ac{moi}.
This helps address a persistent challenge in clinical genetics: the lack of principled priors for variant interpretation that account not only for known pathogenic variants (true positives), but also for unobserved variants and negative evidence (false negative causal pathogenic variant and true negative absence of causal variants) \cite{hannah_using_2024, zschocke_mendelian_2023}. 
By integrating high-resolution allele frequencies from gnomAD \cite{karczewski2020mutational}, curated classifications from ClinVar \cite{landrum_clinvar_2018}, and structured gene-disease associations \cite{martin_panelapp_2019}, 
PanelAppRex can enable the derivation of calibrated genome-wide priors for Bayesian models of genetic risk.

These capabilities go beyond panel lookup to support evidence-aware diagnostics. 
Probabilistic models incorporating both observed and unobserved variation can quantify uncertainty, resolve ambiguous findings, and refine variant prioritisation, scaling naturally to support complex, multi-gene disorders. 
The dataset also provides a substrate for AI-driven approaches to variant interpretation, including probabilistic inference, reinforcement learning, and deep annotation pipelines
\cite{jumper_highly_2021, cheng_accurate_2023}.

Several limitations should be acknowledged. Not all known coding genes are currently linked to a disease panel; we prioritised high-confidence, traceable annotations over broad but less reliable coverage. 
Some genes are over-represented across multiple panels due to historical research biases, leading to non-uniform panel enrichment. 
Additionally, not all panels returned by queries may be equally informative. 
For example, during benchmarking, the COVID-19 research panel frequently appeared alongside the \ac{pid} panel due to overlapping genes. 
While technically accurate, such panels may be less relevant to users focused on clinical  diagnosis of immunodeficiency.
% To consider typical user expectations, we included a subjective ``best match'' choice in each case study.
In bioinformatic workflows, these choices can be refined systematically or excluded using filters or downstream logic.
In one of the five case studies, a disease-based query returned three panels, one of which did not contain the causal gene. This is expected, as broader classifications may include non-specific panels, hindering sensitivity. However, the query was still considered 100\% successful, as the causal gene appeared in the combined result set, consistent with the recommended bioinformatic strategy of using the union of returned panels.

PanelAppRex bridges expert-curated panel knowledge with genome-scale statistical reasoning. 
It offers a robust tool for interactive search, a validated dataset for programmatic access, and a scalable framework for quantitative genomic modelling. 
Future work will focus on expanding supported queries, integrating additional variant types and annotations, and enabling more sophisticated applications in variant interpretation and risk estimation.

\section{Conclusion}
\noindent
PanelAppRex offers a robust solution for aggregating and querying gene panel data. Its sophisticated search feature simplifies data exploration and enhances variant interpretation.
